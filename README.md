# great_places

Flutter project for component studies and setting with the dart language and Flutter framework. 

#### What was achieved with this study:
- Provider;
- Camera access;
- Maps, get current location and select location on map;
- Database - SQLite(sqfite);

**And lots of fun;**

_Long live the flutter, very good experience so far_ üôåüèΩü•∞.
